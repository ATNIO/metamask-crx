MetaMask now lists a new network on our dropdown list: Kovan, a [Proof of Authority](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Proof-of-Authority-Chains) testchain managed by several blockchain organizations such as Digix, Etherscan, and Parity. It is designed to be a more stable and reliable testnet alternative to Ropsten and was created in response to recent attacks that slowed down the Ropsten network. You can read more about Kovan [here](https://medium.com/@Digix/announcing-kovan-a-stable-ethereum-public-testnet-10ac7cb6c85f#.6o8sz8cct) and [here](https://medium.com/@Digix/letter-from-the-ceo-some-context-regarding-kovan-7b5121adb901#.kfv7zhw83). As with Ropsten, the default remote node to connect to Kovan is managed by Infura.
